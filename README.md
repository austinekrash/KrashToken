This Hardhat project serves as a starting point for deploying and testing the Krash token on the Sepolia testnet. It demonstrates best practices for Ethereum smart contract development and testing, making it a valuable resource for developers interested in building and deploying ERC-20 tokens on testnets.

Feel free to explore and modify the project to suit your specific requirements for token development and testing on Sepolia or any other Ethereum testnet.
